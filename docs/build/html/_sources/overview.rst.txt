You would need to setup you system properly before starting with assignments for this course.

For the first part of this course we are going to be working on a remote server, connected trhough SSH (Secure Socket Shell), using Visual Studio Code (VSCode) as our development platform (IDE).

The goal is to setup up a working environment similar to the one depicted in the next image

.. admonition:: Not an exahustive guide

    The objective of this document is to provide a quick reference to help you to accomplish the tasks mentioned above. 
    
    While this is a guide for you to get started, the intention is not to provide an extensive installation manual covering all the possibilities and problems that you could encounter during the setup of these tools. Please refer to the official documentation provided along this document.
