Install Visual Studio Code
==========================

Once you have a working ssh connection to your remote server, it is time to configure a more amicable way to work. 

For that, we are going to use Visual Studio Code. The next section is a brief guide on how to do make it works, but `you can read this link <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh>`_ to get more details on how does it work and how to configure it.

Download and install VS Code
----------------------------

Look for the last version of *VS Code*, download and install it in your computer following the instructions in the site.

After that, open it and install the *Remote Development extension pack* by going to the "extension icon" highligthed in the image below

.. figure:: ./images/vscode_1.png

    :align: center
    :scale: 20%

    select the extension icon

then you will search for the extension named *remote* in the Marketplace, as shown in the figure below. You need to select and install it.

    install extension remote
    
Configure VS Code for working remote
------------------------------------

Once the extension is installed, you need to click over the remote connection icon (1) and then select and click the *Connect Current Windows to Host...* option (2)

    configure remote server

By doing so you will be asked to enter the remote server credentials that you previously used to connect via PuTTY or Terminal, depending on your system (PC or MAC correspondly).

    enter your remote ssh credentials


Upload Publick Key
==================

 Mac
 ____
 If you are working over a Mac, then you should get a successfull connection after you are asked for your passphrase, since you already uploaded your public ssh key in a previous step. 

 Congratulations, you're all setup!

 PC
 ____

 If you're working over a PC you will be asked to enter your remote password to stablish a connection. Enter your password and continue.

 .. figure:: ./images/vscode_6.png 
    :alt: alt text
    :align: center
    :scale: 40%

    enter your password 


After a few seconds you should get a successfull connection. Visual Studio code could open a unix terminal for you, or not. In the first case, you will see a screen similar to the one shown below.

.. figure:: ./images/vscode_7.png 
    :alt: alt text
    :align: center
    :scale: 20%

    enter your remote ssh remote credentials

If you **do not see a unix terminal**, but instead you have this screen

.. figure:: ./images/vscode_8.png
    :alt: alt textt
    :align: center
    :scale: 40 %
    
    there is not a terminal Open
    
Then you need to open it manually by going to the menu and select Terminal->New Terminal.

Now you will proceed to setup your publick key in the remote server. For that you are going to create a new file named *authorized_keys*, change the permissions accordingly, edit the file and paste the public key. 


* create directory and file
.. code-block:: shell

    mkdir -p ~/.ssh && touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys


* change permissions
.. code-block:: shell

    chmod 700 ~/.ssh && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys


* edit file
.. code-block:: shell

    code ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

.. _auth_file:

After you enter the last command, you will see that the editor will open an empty file (authorized_keys). You will need to copy and paste the public key that :ref:`you generate using from PuTTYgen<ssh_public_key>` in a previou step in the process.

.. figure:: ./images/vscode_9.png
    :alt: alt textt
    :align: center
    :scale: 40 %
    
    setting up public key file

save the file and close VS Code. Reopen it and re-stablish a remote connection following the previous steps (click the remote green icon |uniquename| located at the left bottom corner and enter your credentials) .

.. |uniquename| image:: ./images/remote_icon.png
    :scale: 32%

This time you should not be required to enter a password, but your passphrase for your public key. If everything is OK then you should login and be able to connect remotely.


Celebrate !

Congratulations, you did a good job configuring your remote environment. Now it is time to celebrate!
